# Operation Blast Corona
Results from using the BLAST tool on coronavirus. I don't know what it all means, but maybe you will.
## Why I started this project
I started this project because along with coding, I enjoy learning about pathology and stuff like that. I was using ViPR, and I did a BLAST test on the COVID-19 virus. I don't know why I was doing it on my phone, but it was taking F.O.R.E.V.E.R. While waiting, I had an idea: why don't I put my results on GitHub, so maybe someone, maybe a medical worker or something, and my results will help them studying some strain of COVID-19.
## Formats
I will put each test up in plain text and in the `.fasta` format.
## What this will have
Actually, this will also have, other than BLAST tests, genomes. Genomes will be in the `genomes` folder.
## Contributing
Contribute whatever code you can to help kill off COVID. That means genomes, blast files, blast results, 3D proteins, code to help analize strains, whatever. As long as it's helping, it's good.
### Spam
Normally I accept spam, but because of what this is, I do not want you spamming.
